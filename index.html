        <h1>on paper</h1>
        <h2>by Jacqueline Woodson</h2>

        <p>The first time I write my full name

            Jacqueline Amanda Woodson

            without anybody's help
            on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
            I know

            if I wanted to

            I could write anything.

            Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
            becoming
            thoughts outside my head

            becoming sentences

            written by

            Jacqueline Amanda Woodson</p>
